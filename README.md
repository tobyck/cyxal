# Cyxal

A version of Vyxal re-written in C.

## Usage

Well, you can't use it at all yet so... reading the next section would be greatly appreciated.

## Contributing

Note: this project is set up for UNIX-based systems and Windows support has not yet been added.

First make a fork of this repository, or if you have collaborator permissions just make a clone. Once you've done either of those, move on to installing GMP.

### Installing GMP

In order to have arbitrary-precision rationals like Vyxal does, Cyxal uses GMP â€” The GNU Multiple Precision
Arithmetic Library. Installation processes may vary but for most Mac or Linux systems, run the following commands and make sure you're not in the `cyxal/` directory, `~/Downloads` is fine.

```bash
curl https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz --output gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
tar -xf gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz
cd gmp-6.2.1
./configure
make
make check
make install
```

On Linux this should be enough, but on Mac you need to manually copy `libgmp.10.dylib` and `gmp.h` to `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include` respectively. From the same `gmp-6.2.1` you were just in, run:

```bash
cp .libs/libgmp.10.dylib /usr/local/lib
cp gmp.h /usr/local/include
```

If things still aren't working, all I can say is that the official GMP website is [here](https://gmplib.org), and good luck.

### Environment

To build the code, run `make build` (see the makefile for what this does exactly), or to build and run the executable afterwards, use `make run` (in CLion these make targets can be configured in the panel in the top right next the run/build buttons for a much easier process).

Before you go to make more changes, make sure to pull the latest code from the master branch, and I would recommend managing this through your IDE's Git interface. As for specific IDE's it's up to you, but at the time of writing this I'm using JetBrains CLion which comes free with the GitHub education pack.

Please write meaningful commit messages and follow the style guide below.

Thank you!

### Style Guide

- Variable/argument names are `lower_snake_case`
- Structs, enums, and unions are `PascalCase`
- Macros are also `lower_snake_case` unless they are constants, in which case they should be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- The `*` for pointers sits next to the identifier with a space after the type
- Comment where you think it's necessary, but please provide a comment before function definitions describing what it does.
- If in doubt, look around and go off what you see.

### Folder Structure

As a general rule, each source file (`.c`) should have a corresponding header file (`.h`) which contains definitions for types and macros, and function *declarations*, not definitions.  When you need to import a file into another, it's the header file that you include.

Below are descriptions of what each folder is for.

- `src`: Contains the source code (seperated into further folders) from which an executable is compiled.
  - `parser`: Contains the tokeniser to split code into a flat list of simple tokens e.g. "number" or "open structure", and the parser which groups those tokens to be executed by the interpreter.
  - `builtins`: Contains types and methods regarding the `CyValue` struct which is used to store any type available in Cyxal, and files containing the elements, modifiers, and structures.
- `build`: Files from `src` are compiled into an executable which lives here. This folder can be emptied with `make clean`.
- `gmp`: Files for the GMP.
