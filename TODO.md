# Todo list

- [ ] Fix *all* memory leaks
- [ ] Write element tests
- [ ] Get AST node structure working (parser.h)
- [ ] Write the beginnings of a parser
- [ ] Implement some simple modifiers
- [ ] Get some basic functionality in the compiler with the LLVM C API (useful links I've
  found [here](https://www.pauladamsmith.com/blog/2015/01/how-to-get-started-with-llvm-c-api.html), [here](https://mapping-high-level-constructs-to-llvm-ir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic-constructs/structures.html),
  and [here](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) for when we get to that point)
